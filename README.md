# number-guessing-game

A program that I coded while following along an assignment for an AI class. 

It let you play against the computer, which will pick a number from 0 to 1000. You are allowed to ask questions to narrow down the secret number. The question you can ask is very specific, which requires you to pick a number to subtract from the secret number and a prime number to divide by the result. The number to subtract has to be less than or equal to the prime number. The computer will tell you if the number after subtraction is divisible by the prime number you picked.

It's probably really hard to play. Might add more questions to ask that would make guessing easier.
